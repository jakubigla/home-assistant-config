# Garden

> Automated irrigation for 3 lawn zones and drip irrigation, driven by mode profiles with heat-aware Smart scheduling.

## How It Works

### Scheduled Irrigation

<!-- /svg:keep -->

Single daily trigger:

- **04:00** — picks lawn+drip (full), lawn-only, or drip-only based on profile + per-type skip sensors. Drip runs once per day on the same days as lawn.

A **one-off run** can be armed from the dashboard (pick type + datetime, tap Schedule). It fires once at the chosen time, independent of the recurring schedule and ignoring rain skip. It aborts if any valve is already open or any irrigation script is running, and disarms itself at fire time.

Per-type skip:

- **Lawn skip** — lawn season (May–Sep), raining now, **accumulated rain ≥ 3 mm** (Open-Meteo, last 24h + next 12h, via `sensor.garden_rain_accumulation`), or soil moisture > 65% (disabled-ready — activates once a `sensor.garden_soil_moisture` exists). The mm rule is **fail-open**: if Open-Meteo is unreachable the sensor reads `unavailable` and `float(0)` keeps it from forcing a skip (raining-now still guards active rain). A few drops (< 3 mm) won't skip.
- **Drip skip** — drip season (May–Oct) or raining now. No accumulation/forecast lookahead — drip OK with rain coming since foliage stays dry.

### Modes

`input_select.garden_irrigation_mode` controls everything. The mode persists across HA restarts. Named modes ignore the calendar month — they run as configured. Only Smart and Seasonal inspect the month.

**One source of truth.** Every mode's schedule (days, AM/PM times, per-zone durations, cycles, drip) is defined ONCE in a `resolve_day` macro inside `sensor.garden_schedule_brain` (in `garden_irrigation_profile.yaml`). The brain exposes `today` (current day's resolved dict) and `schedule_7day` (next 7 days). `sensor.garden_irrigation_profile` is a thin set of cross-sensor readers of `today` (keeps its old attribute names for back-compat). `garden_next_run` and the dashboard 7-day table render `schedule_7day` — none of them re-derive the schedule, so they can't drift. To change/add a mode, edit the `tbl` dict (or the Seasonal/Smart resolver) in the brain — one place.

| Mode | Per-zone lawn (z1 / z2 / z3) | Lawn total | Lawn freq | Drip dur | Drip freq |
|------|------|------|------|------|------|
| **Manual** | — | — | — | — | — |
| **Eco** | 30m / 18m / 18m | 1h06 | Tue + Sat (2×/wk) | 45m ×1/day | Tue + Sat |
| **Standard** | 30m / 18m / 18m | 1h06 | Mon + Wed + Fri (3×/wk) | 45m ×1/day | Mon + Wed + Fri |
| **Intensive** | 35m / 21m / 21m | 1h17 | Mon + Tue + Thu + Fri (4×/wk) | 45m ×1/day | Mon + Tue + Thu + Fri |
| **Testing** | 30s / 30s / 30s | 90s | daily | 30s ×1/day | daily |
| **Smart** | per heat tier (see below) | — | per heat tier | per month | per month |
| **Seasonal** | from helpers (see below) | — | per month, **twice daily** | 45m ×1/day | **Mon + Thu (2×/wk)** |

Eco and Standard share durations — they differ only in frequency (deep + infrequent vs steady summer). Intensive bumps both for peak heat. **Zone weighting is one shared rule:** z2 = z3 = `round(z1 × 0.6)` for every mode (Testing is flat — `weighted: false`). So Intensive z1=35 → 35/21/21.

**Seasonal mode** — a twice-daily May–Sep schedule, single pass (no cycle & soak), durations from the `input_number` helpers `garden_lawn_minutes_standard` (15m) and `garden_lawn_minutes_july` (18m). The helper value is **zone 1**; z2/z3 = `round(z1 × 0.6)` (preserves the south-slope weighting). `cycle_count` is forced to **1** for Seasonal (durations are single-pass totals).

| Month | Days | AM | PM | z1 / z2 / z3 |
|-------|------|----|----|--------------|
| May | Mon / Thu | 05:00 | — | 15 / 9 / 9 |
| Jun | Mon / Wed / Fri | 05:00 | 17:00 | 15 / 9 / 9 |
| Jul | Mon / Wed / Fri | 05:00 | 17:00 | 18 / 11 / 11 |
| Aug | Mon / Wed / Fri | 05:00 | 17:00 | 15 / 9 / 9 |
| Sep | Mon / Thu | 06:00 | — | 15 / 9 / 9 |

Drip runs **Mon + Thu only** (2×/week, decoupled from lawn frequency), 45m, on the AM session. PM sessions are lawn-only. Handled by `automation.garden_seasonal_irrigation` (separate from the 04:00 `garden_scheduled_irrigation`, which excludes Seasonal so they never double-fire).

### Smart Mode with Heat Tiers

**Smart mode** routes irrigation dynamically based on the month and today's forecast heat. `sensor.garden_forecast_today` (state = forecast high °C; attributes: `uv`, `condition`) feeds a `heat_tier` classification:

| Tier | Condition | AM depth (`am_ratio`) | Morning z1 |
|------|-----------|-----------------------|------------|
| **Mild** | < 26°C | 1.0 (base) | base |
| **Hot** | 26–30°C | 1.4 if sunny (UV ≥ 6 + partly cloudy/sunny), else 1.0 | base |
| **Scorcher** | ≥ 31°C | 1.4 (always) | base + 5 min (cap 35m) |

The Smart base schedule follows the calendar month (Standard for May–Jun, Intensive for Jul–Aug, Eco for Sep, drip-only in Oct, off Nov–Apr). **Heat changes DEPTH, never frequency or timing.** Smart always runs ONE morning session on the fixed tier day-set (e.g. Standard Tue/Thu/Sat); on hot days the extra water folds into a deeper 04:00 run (`am_ratio` 1.4 — z1 30→42m, sides 18→25m; Scorcher also +5 min z1) rather than a 17:00 top-up, avoiding evening leaf-wetness. There is **no evening session and no min-gap guard** in Smart — the schedule days are the spacing.

The current `heat_tier` is surfaced on the Outdoor dashboard as a thermometer chip (green Mild / orange Hot / red Scorcher) in the "At a Glance" row. The chip is only populated when mode is Smart; otherwise it shows `—`.

Smart has no evening automation (`garden_smart_evening` was removed). Only **Seasonal** mode still runs a 17:00 PM session via `script.garden_lawn_irrigation_pm`.

**Smart mode by month (base, before heat overlay):**

| Month | Inherits | Lawn freq | Drip freq |
|-------|----------|-----------|-----------|
| May–Jun | Standard | Mon + Wed + Fri | Mon + Wed + Fri |
| Jul–Aug | Intensive | Mon + Tue + Thu + Fri | Mon + Tue + Thu + Fri |
| Sep | Eco | Tue + Sat | Tue + Sat |
| Oct | drip-only | — | 45m every 3 days |
| Nov–Apr | OFF | — | — |

### Smart Drip (soil-driven)

In Smart mode, drip irrigation is **not scheduled** — it runs on demand when the flowerbeds dry out. Three soil probes (`sensor.pergola_left_flowerbed_soil_moisture`, `sensor.pergola_right_flowerbed_soil_moisture`, `sensor.sona_flowerbed_soil_moisture`) determine when to fire.

`sensor.garden_drip_soil_status` tracks the decision state (state-based, not trigger-based — always fresh after reload):

- **armed** — waiting for the driest bed to drop below the `start_pct` threshold (default 35%)
- When driest < 35% → run drip, then disarm
- Re-arms when driest recovers above `stop_pct` (default 60%) — hysteresis prevents rapid cycling
- **Veto gates:** raining, out of season (Oct–Apr), pergola beds saturated above `sat_pct` (default 70%), within `min_days_between` of last run, night quiet hours (22:00–04:30), or drip valve already open

`automation.garden_drip_soil_run` checks probes on every state change plus every 30 min. `automation.garden_drip_soil_arm` re-arms when the driest bed climbs back above `stop_pct`. Both notify on run and on dry-but-vetoed skips.

### How Valves Are Controlled

The **auto-off automation** is the single source of truth for durations. Any valve that opens — schedule, script, or HomeKit — gets automatically closed after the profile-driven duration. Scripts open valves and wait for them to close.

The **lawn irrigation script** runs zones sequentially. The **full irrigation script** chains lawn → drip.

### Cleanup Safety

The cleanup automation closes all valves when an irrigation script ends. To avoid killing the parent during chained runs, it skips when `script.garden_full_irrigation` is still running.

### On-Demand Control

All 4 valves and 3 sequence scripts are exposed to **HomeKit**:

- Open any individual valve — auto-off handles the duration
- Close any valve — stops immediately
- Trigger `script.garden_lawn_irrigation` — runs all 3 zones sequentially
- Trigger `script.garden_drip_irrigation` — drip only
- Trigger `script.garden_full_irrigation` — lawn zones then drip

### Run Lawn Now (on-demand, slider duration)

The dashboards (tablet Outdoor + phone Garden room) carry a **Run Lawn Now** block: one Minutes-per-zone slider (`input_number.garden_ondemand_minutes`, 1–25 min) and a single **Run Lawn** button. Tap it → the whole lawn runs zones 1→2→3 sequentially (one pass, no soak), each zone for the slider's minutes, regardless of the profile durations.

`script.garden_ondemand_lawn` (`mode: single`) owns the timing: it sets `input_boolean.garden_ondemand_active`, then for each zone opens the valve, waits the slider duration, closes it (5s gap between zones), and clears the flag at the end. While that flag is on, **auto-off skips lawn valves** (the gate at the top of `garden_valve_auto_off`) so the slider duration wins instead of the profile duration. Drip, profile-driven lawn runs, and HomeKit-manual opens are unaffected. The button shows which zone is currently watering while it runs.

- One at a time — `mode: single`, so a second tap mid-run is ignored.
- Always runs — no rain skip; you decide based on weather.
- Aborts + notifies if any lawn zone valve is `unavailable`.
- Each single valve open is the slider duration (≤25 min < the 30-min max-open watchdog cap), so a healthy run never trips it; a crash mid-run is still backstopped by the watchdog, and `garden_valve_startup_close` clears the flag on every boot.

## Gotchas

- **Valves can't run simultaneously** — the Tuya controller doesn't support it.
- **Auto-off reads duration at valve-open time** — changing mode mid-run won't affect an already-running valve.
- **Zones 5-8 on the Tuya controller are unused** — hardware supports 4 zones.
- **`schedule_7day` sizes each day's heat off ITS OWN forecast** — the dashboard table reads `sensor.garden_forecast_today`'s per-day `forecast_7day`. It re-evaluates at fire time (04:00), so a cool-down tonight changes tomorrow's real run; days past the ~6-day forecast horizon fall back to Mild.
- **No min-gap guard, no deferral trap** — Smart no longer gates on hours-since-last-run. A `min_gap_hours` floor on a fixed-day 04:00 scheduler is a deferral trap: it can only skip a slot, never retry when the gap clears, so an off-schedule manual run could push the next run to the following schedule day (~90h). The schedule days ARE the spacing. See knowledge **irrigation-run-cadence-gates**.
- **Smart drip soil probes** — capacitive sensors; calibrate thresholds to your bed. Don't rely on the factory-default numbers.

## Entities

**Valves:** `valve.lawn_sprinkler_zone_1`, `valve.lawn_sprinkler_zone_2`, `valve.lawn_sprinkler_zone_3`, `valve.drip_irrigation`

**Mode:** `input_select.garden_irrigation_mode` — Manual / Eco / Standard / Intensive / Testing / Smart / Seasonal

**One-off run:**
- `input_select.garden_oneoff_type` — Lawn / Drip / Full
- `input_datetime.garden_oneoff_at` — when the one-off fires
- `input_boolean.garden_oneoff_armed` — on = armed; auto-clears at fire time

**On-demand lawn run:**
- `input_number.garden_ondemand_minutes` — per-zone run duration, 1–25 min
- `input_boolean.garden_ondemand_active` — on while an on-demand run owns the lawn valves; gates auto-off off for lawn valves

**Seasonal mode:**
- `input_number.garden_lawn_minutes_standard` — zone-1 base minutes for Seasonal (default 15); z2/z3 = round(×0.6)
- `input_number.garden_lawn_minutes_july` — zone-1 base minutes in July (default 18)

**Smart drip soil thresholds:**
- `input_number.garden_drip_soil_start` — fire below this % (default 35)
- `input_number.garden_drip_soil_stop` — re-arm above this % (default 60)
- `input_number.garden_drip_soil_sat` — saturation veto threshold for pergola beds (default 70)
- `input_number.garden_drip_min_days_between` — cooldown between soil-driven drip runs (default 1 day)
- `input_boolean.garden_drip_armed` — on = ready to fire when driest bed drops below start_pct

**Sensors:**
- `sensor.garden_forecast_today` — today's forecast high °C; attributes: `uv` index, `condition` string. Feeds Smart heat tier. Fail-safe: defaults to 0/0/unknown → Mild tier.
- `binary_sensor.garden_lawn_should_skip` — on = skip lawn (season / raining / rain ≥3mm / soil >65%); `reason` attribute names the cause
- `binary_sensor.garden_drip_should_skip` — on = skip drip
- `binary_sensor.garden_should_skip_irrigation` — legacy alias of lawn skip
- `sensor.garden_rain_accumulation` — Open-Meteo summed precipitation (mm) over last 24h + next 12h; drives the lawn ≥3mm skip; fail-open if the API is down. URL from `!secret garden_rain_url`
- `sensor.garden_lawn_next_run` / `sensor.garden_drip_next_run` — next scheduled run (Seasonal-aware: AM/PM slots, Mon/Thu drip)
- `sensor.garden_schedule_brain` — the single source of truth (the `resolve_day` macro). Attributes: `today` (current day's full resolved dict), `schedule_7day` (list of next-7-days `{date, dow, lawn_am_min, lawn_pm_min, drip_min, sessions}`)
- `sensor.garden_irrigation_profile` — thin cross-sensor reader of the brain's `today`. Attributes: `effective_mode`, `heat_tier` (Mild/Hot/Scorcher or 'n/a' when not Smart), `am_ratio` (1.0 base, 1.4 on a hot Smart day — deepens the AM run), `lawn_durations` (per-zone seconds), `lawn_durations_pm` (Smart always 0 — no PM session; ≈60% for Seasonal), `cycle_count` (1 — single-pass, no cycle-and-soak), `soak_minutes` (0), `drip_duration`, `drip_runs_per_day`, `lawn_today`, `drip_today`, `am_time`, `pm_time`. (`min_gap_hours` is still computed but no longer read by any automation — dead.)
- `sensor.garden_drip_soil_status` — Smart drip decision engine. State: `armed_waiting`, `ready`, `vetoed_rain`, `vetoed_saturation`, `cooldown_days`, `night`, `out_of_season`, `disarmed`, `no_data`. Attributes: `driest`, `wettest`, `start_pct`, `stop_pct`, `sat_pct`, `days_since_run`, `blocking_reason`

**Scripts:**
- `script.garden_lawn_irrigation` — zones 1→2→3 sequential
- `script.garden_drip_irrigation` — drip only
- `script.garden_full_irrigation` — lawn then drip
- `script.garden_ondemand_lawn` — whole lawn (zones 1→2→3) for the slider duration; manual path with night-guard + already-open + offline checks (no weather/soil skip — manual overrides those)
- `script.garden_lawn_irrigation_pm` — PM top-up — zones 1→2→3 single pass at `lawn_durations_pm` (≈40% of AM for Smart, ≈60% for Seasonal)
